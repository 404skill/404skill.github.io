# Scooter Rental System â€” Overview

This project challenges you to build a comprehensive system for managing electric scooter rentals. You'll develop a solution that handles user management, scooter inventory, rental logic, location tracking, and payment processing.

## Learning Objectives

- Designing and implementing a database schema for a rental business
- Building authentication and authorization systems
- Creating geospatial functionality for location tracking
- Implementing payment processing and financial calculations
- Developing a containerized application with a consistent API

## Project Context

Electric scooters have become a popular urban transportation option in many cities worldwide. Companies that operate these services need robust backend systems to manage their fleet of scooters, track user activity, process payments, and ensure the scooters are properly distributed throughout the city.

In this project, you'll build the core backend services needed to run such a business. Your system will need to handle user registrations, track scooter availability, process rentals, monitor scooter locations, and manage payments.

## Getting Started

1. Download the project template, which includes a containerized environment and test suite.
2. Follow the task prompts in order, as each builds upon the previous one.
3. Use the container API to validate your implementation against the test suite.
4. Remember that you can implement your solution in any language, as long as it conforms to the container API specification.

Good luck, and enjoy building your Scooter Rental System!
