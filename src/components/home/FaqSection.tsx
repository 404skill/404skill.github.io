    q: "Do I need to install anything?",
    a: "Yes. Each project ships as a containerised starter repository so you can run databases, queues, and the test suites locally in minutes. You will need to download both Docker Desktop and our CLI tool through NPM - See \"Get Started\" Page.",
  },
  {
    q: "How hard are the projects? Are there beginner-friendly ones?",
    a: "There are projects in varying difficulty levels, some are also beginner-friendly and include more guidance and hints.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I get stuck?",
    a: "Ask questions in the community discord, use the hints and guidance in the project's specs.",
  },

    q: "How do I run tests and submit my solution?",
    a: "You will run the tests using our cli tool, see the \"Get Started\" page."

    q: "How long does a typical project take to complete?",
    a: "Depends on your pace. Some finish a project in a day, others take a week. Each oneâ€™s broken into clear checkpoints so you can move at your own speed without getting lost."
